WAITING TO BE PUSHED

WORKING ON

TO DO
- back office to add sounds
- remake conception docs
- rgpd / contact
- instead of showing nothing in the beginning when searching sounds/ambiances, explain better and add a button to beign search with a random theme

- better looping for sounds (dont cut between loop)
- show more informations on sounds (show when they play, show when they will play, show their duration)
- add youtube audio
- fix sound modifications
- delete account
- in sound table, remove possible default options (all sounds will have same everything at the beginning i think)
- playlist system (button to add in playlist in ambiance card) and in search ambiance menu : button show playlist => shoaw ambiance cards with mroe options (play for x minutes, move position..)
- start need to loops at a random time of their duration (avoid 2 same loops playing exactly the smae audio at the same time)
- when scrolling down the search ambiance menu : every 10 ambiances, show a loading state to load 10 more (load icon + "loading more ambiances")
- autosave after 10 seconds after a current ambiance modification

CONSIDER
A - in ambiance card : categories and themes ordered only by quantity, not categories always first
A - in search ambiance menu : drop down next to name to show more ambiance infos
C - don't change pitch when changing speed option ?
C - study stereo vs mono sounds
